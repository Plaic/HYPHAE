GD Addon *united* by Plaic!

It was made using Golden Days' Base.
REMEMBER: I'm NOT the owner of Golden Days.
All the rights goes to PoeticRainbow and the Golden Days community 
and Mojang, of course.

This addon was made for fun, and not for any sort of 
merchandise or money earning, advertising or anything like that!!!

Anyways,

The pack compiles multiple items from multiple versions and similar
items that you would see in most of these really nostalgic games and
also from Minecraft itself

MAIN INSPIRATIONS:
Oldschool Minecraft and its features

Minecraft Modding community
even more that I can't remember


OTHER INSPIRATIONS:

Multiple RPG Games

MAIN CREDITS:

The Minecraft community itself
Mojang and Notch
and
You!
