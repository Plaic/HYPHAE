**2. Now download Golden Days... but...**
I can't redistribute redistribute the resource pack, so you will have to download it yourself.

**3. Make an instance.**
It can be any launcher: TLauncher, ATLauncher, MultiMC, any of them. Even the glitchy malfunctioning Minecraft launcher lol

Make a **1.16.5 instance WITH FORGE**
Then put the files inside the instance (mods in mods, config in config, etc.)

#### **REMEMBER TO PUT GOLDEN DAYS IN RESOURCE PACKS AS WELL**
