# INSTALLATION GUIDE
***
**1. You will need Crimbeetle, the modpack itself, of course.**

#### Actually I don't need to put the download link twice. The downlaod link is in README.md.
***
**2. Now download Golden Days... but...**
I can't redistribute redistribute the resource pack, so you will have to download it yourself. 

#### Click [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/golden-days) to download Golden Days.
***
**3. Make an instance.**
It can be any launcher: TLauncher, ATLauncher, MultiMC, any of them.

Make a **1.16.5 instance WITH FORGE**.
Then put the files inside the instance (mods in mods, config in config, etc.)

#### **REMEMBER TO PUT GOLDEN DAYS IN RESOURCE PACKS AS WELL!**
***
**4. Start up Minecraft.**
Start up Minecraft, then check your resource packs.
If they are deorganized, organize them in this order:

- **Crimbeetle Sounds Addon**
- **Crimbeetle Resource Pack**
- **Golden Days Base**
- **Programmer Art**
- **...**
***
# **And voilá! You're done!**
